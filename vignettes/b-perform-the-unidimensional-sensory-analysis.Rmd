# `plot_unidim_analysis()`: Create the plot with the unidimensional analysis

With `plot_unidim_analysis()`, you can create an interactive plot to visualize the intensity of the different sensory attributes in the products. The graph displays the products on the x-axis, and the average intensity on the y-axis (on a 0-10 scale). There are as many graphs as there are sensory attributes. The graph is interactive, so you can decide to display only certain products, for example. 


```{r examples-perform_unidim_analysis, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%'}
data("data_profiles_toy")

plot_unidim_analysis(
  data_profiles = data_profiles_toy
)
```
