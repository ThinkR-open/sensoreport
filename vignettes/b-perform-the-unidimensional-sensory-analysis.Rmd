# `plot_unidim_analysis()`: Create the plot with the unidimensional analysis

With `plot_unidim_analysis()`, you can create an interactive plot to visualize the number of time each product has been associated to a specific sensory attribute (name of the group).

The graph displays the products on the x-axis, and the number of times is has been associated to a specific sensory attribute. 

There are as many graphs as there are sensory attributes. The graph is interactive, so you can decide to display only certain products, for example. 


```{r examples-perform_unidim_analysis, out.width = '100%', out.height = '100%'}
data("data_sensory_toy")

plot_unidim_analysis(
  data_sensory = data_sensory_toy
)
```
