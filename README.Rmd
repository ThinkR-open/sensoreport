{sensoreport} is a *demo* Shiny application dedicated to the creation of **automated**, **reproducible**, **interactive** and **ready-to-share** sensory/consumer reports.

Such tool can enable sensory analysts and panel leaders to spend less time preparing reports, and add more value to their work.

## When software development meets sensory sciences to create and share ad-hoc reproducible sensory reports: Opportunities & challenges

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/softwaresensory.png")
```

## Demo app

The app is available here: https://connect.thinkr.fr/sensoreport/
